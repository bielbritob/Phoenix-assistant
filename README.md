# * Phoenix-assistant
An personal creation that uses machine learning and some algorithms to assist the "send task" of the classrom. And a beaultiful interface made 90% by me 

(It's a school fair project)

(after extracting .zip goto "data" folder and configure the "discordChannels" and "discordToken" to work 100%, or ignore this if u dont want send messages for discord)
